# one instance variable: line.
# we should be able to call "take a number" that takes a customer's name, appends their number to their name and adds them to the line.
 
# The line could look like this: ["1. Ashley", "2. Steve", "3. Blake"] 
 
# we should be able to call a method called "now_serving" that removes the customer who is first in line and returns their name.
 
# Write a test and then write the class.
