Nested Resources

Create 2 resources using a scaffold, nest them.

Build the create action for the nested resource.  So for example, posts have many comments, I have a form that can create a new comment for a particular post.

Examples:
Parks have many waterslides, build a form for a water slide
You guys have many stories (that you won't tell me), build a form for a story
