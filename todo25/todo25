There is something wrong with this page.
Using your web inspector identify what is wrong.
As algorithmically as possible, explain why this error causes this visual effect.
What are the other things wrong with this page? Why do you think they are wrong?
When was this page made? How? Explain how you figured it out.

The problem is that each h3 becomes increasingly larger on the page.
Using inspect element, it seems that each new h3 is nested in the previous h3.
This makes each subsequent h3 larger than the previous one.

Other problems:
Repetitive font formatting (color and face) for each h3.
Weird/horrible logo

The site uses HTML 3.2, which came out in 1997. 
I assume this webpage was made sometime around then.
